Capstone Course Final Exercise: HadvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science

According to the World Health Organization, strokes are responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths
worldwide, and were the second leading cause of mortality in 2019, only behind ischaemic heart disease.

1. Introduction

In this report we describe the process for training various classification models with the intention of predicting
whether a patient is prone to stroke, and taking appropriate action before it occurs.
The best model, according to the selected comparison criteria, turned out to be Flexible Discriminant
Analysis, together with a data balancing method based on the selection of variables that is supposed
to guarantee the best estimates.

The objective of this project is to find a model capable of predicting whether a patient has a tendency to
suffer a stroke, based on the following variables:

1. Gender (binary)
2. Age (numerical)
3. Hypertension (binary)
4. Heart disease (binary)
5. Ever married (binary)
6. Type of residence (binary)
7. Average glucose level (numerical)
8. Body mass index (numerical)
9. Smoking status (categorical)

The selected model must have a high Sensitivity, without sacrificing too much Specificity.
