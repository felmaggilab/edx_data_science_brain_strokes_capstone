Capstone Course Final Exercise: HadvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science

According to the World Health Organization, strokes are responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths
worldwide, and were the second leading cause of mortality in 2019, only behind ischaemic heart disease.

In this report we describe the process for training various classification models with the intention of predicting
whether a patient is prone to stroke, and taking appropriate action before it occurs.
The best model, according to the selected comparison criteria, turned out to be Flexible Discriminant
Analysis, together with a data balancing method based on the selection of variables that is supposed
to guarantee the best estimates.
